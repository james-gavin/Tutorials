# Tutorials
These tutorials aim to provide myself and others a resource to solve common issues when programming.

Most of these tutorials are written for Ubuntu or Windows. Personally I feel that these two OS can
cover most problems in any OS I have dealt with. If need be more tutorials for different operating
systems will be created.

Feel free to copy, use or distrubte these tutorials, nothing special here :)
